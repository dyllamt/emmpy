# emmpy
A Python implementation of the effective mass model (EMM).  The EMM is usefull for modeling the experimental Seebeck coefficient and conductivity of inorganic and organic semiconductors. 

This implementation uses "s" the notation used in https://www.nature.com/articles/nmat4784. Although researchers in the thermoelectric field may be more used to the notation in A. May and G. J. Snyder _Introduction to Modeling Thermoelectric Transport at High Temperatures_ (2012), the assumption that non-polar phonon scattering limits conduction corresponds to s=1.
