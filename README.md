# emmpy
A Python implementation of the effective mass model (EMM).  The EMM is usefull for modeling the experimental Seebeck coefficient and conductivity of inorganic and organic semiconductors. 

This implementation uses the "s" the notation of https://www.nature.com/articles/nmat4784. Materials researchers in the thermoelectric field may be acustomed to the notation in A. May and G. J. Snyder _Introduction to Modeling Thermoelectric Transport at High Temperatures_ (2012), but the case where non-polar phonon scattering limits conduction corresponds to s=1.
