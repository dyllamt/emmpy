# emmpy
The Python implementation of the effective mass model.

This model treats the experimental transport properties of (Seebeck coefficient and conductivity) of semiconductors. 

This implementation uses the notation of S. Kang and G. J. Snyder _Charge-transport model for conducting polymers_ (2017) and can treat both organic and inorganic semiconductors.

When non-polar phonon scattering limits conduction in a crystaline semiconductor, s=1.
