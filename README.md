# emmpy
A Python implementation of the effective mass model (EMM). The EMM is usefull for modeling the experimental transport properties of (Seebeck coefficient and conductivity) of semiconductors. 

This implementation uses the "s" notation of https://www.nature.com/articles/nmat4784. Although materials scientists in the thermoelectrics field may be acustomed to the notation in A. May and G. J. Snyder _Introduction to Modeling Thermoelectric Transport at High Temperatures_ (2012), the notation is more general and can treat organics as well as inorganic, crystaline semiconductors.

When non-polar phonon scattering limits conduction in a crystaline semiconductor, s=1.
