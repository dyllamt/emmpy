# emmpy
The Python implementation of the effective mass model, which treats experimental transport properties of semiconductors.

This implementation uses the notation of S. Kang and G. J. Snyder _Charge-transport model for conducting polymers_ (2017) and can treat both organic and inorganic semiconductors. When non-polar phonon scattering limits conduction, s=1.
